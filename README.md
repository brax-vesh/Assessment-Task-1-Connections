# Pythonnections: The New York Times Connections Game in Python

 I have created a remake of The New York Times' Connections game within python. This game was created by Braxton Vescio on 3/4/2024 as a year 11 software engineering project.

 ## How To Play:

 A grid of random words is displayed on a 4 x 4 grid, but they all fit into groups of 4 under one category! your job is to figure out which words fit together. To select which words you think fit together, simply type out one at a time entering each one individually, once you have typed four words the game will tell you if you got the category right or not.
 
 You have four lives and need to find 4 categories to win. GOOD LUCK!

 ## Installation:

 1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/brax-vesh/Assessment-Task-1-Connections
 2. Navigate to the cloned repository
 3. Run the game: Pythonnections!
